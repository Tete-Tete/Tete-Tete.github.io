I am Chinese and moved to the USA when I was 14 years old. I completed my high school education in Pensacola, Florida, and earned my undergraduate degree in Statistics from SUNY Buffalo. Initially, I pursued Computer Science during my freshman year but switched to Statistics in my sophomore year as I found Computer Science to be quite challenging. I am currently studying Data Science at Northwestern University. While it may sound daunting, I am dedicated to improving my coding skills and doing my best in this field.\nGraph ","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/test-chinese/","title":"Self-introduction"}]
